MicroByte is a hand-held and open-source retro-console powered by the ESP32-WROVER. The firmware included on this repository, is focused on achieve a modular architecture to simplify the usage and allow add easily modifications.

(**If you're lookig for general information of this project, please visit the next link: [GitHub microByte](https://github.com/jfm92/microByte)**)

The basic architecture of the software is shown in the next diagram:

// add diagram

If you want to test or modify this software you need to do the following steps.

# Development enviorement:

This software was developed using ESP-IDF which is the development environment for Espressif MCU's. The next steps will show the most compatible development set-up for this project.

You can also use the development set-up explained on the Espressif guides, but it could give some problems once you try to compile the project.

- [ESP-IDF Set-Up](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32s2/get-started/index.html)

## What you need:

### Hardware:

- microByte console.
- USB type C to type A cable.
- PC with Windows 10 or Linux. (macOS should work but it wasn't tested).

### Software:

#### Linux:

- Ubuntu 18.04 (Ubuntu 20.04 also works but give some problems with Python2.5)
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com).

#### Windows:

- Windows 10 version 1903 or higher.
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com).
- [WSL1](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10) (Windows Subsystem for Linux)
- [Ubuntu 18.04 LTS for WSL](https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9N9TNGVNDL3Q).
- [Windows Terminal](https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9N0DX20HK701)

## Get ESP-IDF:

When you're using WSL in Windows you're running Linux natively on Windows, so the dependencies are the same on both O.S. because basically we're using the same O.S.

Open a terminal (Windows terminal in Windows) and execute the next commands to install the ESP-IDF dependencies:

```console
sudo apt-get update

sudo apt-get install git wget flex bison gperf python python-pip python-setuptools cmake ninja-build ccache libffi-dev libssl-dev dfu-util
```

Create workspace folder.

### Windows

To have the possibility of managing these files directly from Windows interface I recommend placing the workspace folder on the mounted folder.

```console
mkdir /mnt/c/Users/<user_name>/Documents/esp-ws
cd /mnt/c/Users/<user_name>/Documents/esp-ws
```

This give you access to the workspace throught the Documents folder of Windows.

Download ESP-IDF version 4.3.
```console
git clone https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf -b v4.3
```

Install the ESP-IDF
```console
cd /mnt/c/Users/<user_name>/Documents/esp-ws/esp-idf
./install.sh
. ./export.sh
```

Note: Each time you open a new terminal you need to reinstall the ESP-IDF, but the process only takes a few seconds.

### Linux

```console
mkdir ~/esp-ws
cd ~/esp-ws
```


Download ESP-IDF version 4.3.
```console
git clone https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf -b v4.3
```

Install the ESP-IDF
```console
cd ~/esp-ws/esp-idf
./install.sh
. ./export.sh
```

Note: Each time you open a new terminal you need to reinstall the ESP-IDF, but the process only takes a few seconds.


## Build:

On the same previous console execute the next commands.

Note: It's the same process for both O.S.

```console
git clone https://github.com/jfm92/microByte_firmware --recursive
```

To build type the next commands:
```console
cd microByte_firmware
idf.py build
```
(The newest Espressif builder use idf.py to compile.)


The build process could take a few minutes. If everything goes fine it should return the next output:

```console
Generating esp32.project.ld
LD build/microByte.elf
esptool.py v2.9-dev
To flash all build output, run 'make flash' or:
python /mnt/c/Users/microByte/Documents/wsl_workspace/esp-idf/components/esptool_py/esptool/esptool.py --chip esp32 --port /dev/ttyS4 --baud 2000000 --before default_reset --after hard_reset write_flash -z --flash_mode dio --flash_freq 80m --flash_size detect 0xd000 /mnt/c/Users/microByte/Documents/wsl_workspace/esp_ws/projects/microbyte/build/ota_data_initial.bin 0x1000 /mnt/c/Users/microByte/Documents/wsl_workspace/esp_ws/projects/microbyte/build/bootloader/bootloader.bin 0x10000 /mnt/c/Users/microByte/Documents/wsl_workspace/esp_ws/projects/microbyte/build/microByte.bin 0x8000 /mnt/c/Users/microByte/Documents/wsl_workspace/esp_ws/projects/microbyte/build/partitions.bin
```

Now your binary is compiled and ready to be flash.

Don't close this console, because it will use previous points indications.

## Flash:

Before flash the device, you need to connect the USB cable, turn on the microByte device and get the serial port assigned to the device.

Each O.S. is slightly different:

### Windows:

On the search box, type: Device Manager.

You will see something like the next image.

![](images/device_manager.png)

In this image you can see that the device is connected to COM4 (Highlighted in yellow), so on the WSL the device will be **/dev/ttyS4**

Type the next command on the previous terminal to start the flash process:

```console
make -j12 flash ESPPORT=/dev/ttyS4 ESPBAUD=2000000
````
ESPPORT: Is the serial port which is connected the device.
ESPBAUD: Flash baud rate. By default, we set the highest possible 2MBit

If everything goes fine, it should return the next output:

```console
App "microByte" version: 2c8dc71

```

The device will reset and initialize the system.

### Linux:

On the console type the next command:

```console
dmesg
```
This should return the next output:
```console
[   39.617382] usb 2-2.2: Product: USB Serial
[   39.651784] usbcore: registered new interface driver usbserial_generic

[   39.664416] usb 2-2.2: ch341-uart converter now attached to ttyUSB0
```

We are looking for the CH341-UART device, and we can see that it was attach to ``ttyUSB0``.

To flash the device, we just need to the next command on the same previous console:

```console
make -j12 flash ESPPORT=/dev/ttyUSB0 ESPBAUD=2000000
```

If everything  goes fine it should return the next output:

```console

The device will reset and initialize the system.


## Debug monitor:

The microByte device implements the ESP-IDF log message system to have full access to the log message. This is a useful tool when you're developing a new feature, or you just want to know deeply what is doing the device.

You need to follow the next steps:
- Install the ESP-IDF. As it was mentioned on previous point, each time you close the terminal is necessary to reinstall.
- Get the serial port. The process to obtain the serial port is explained on the previous point.
- Finally execute the next command:


```console
make -j12 monitor ESPPORT=<serial-port> ESPBAUD=2000000
```

This should output somenthing like this:

```console

This previous piece of console log is the full initialization of the device.

If you want to close this log monitor, you just need to press ``ctrl +``.

As curiosity, you can see the games framerate on the log monitor when you execute a game of any console.
